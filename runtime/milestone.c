 * Fixed-capacity open-addressed table, never rehashed. Lookups are lock-free;
 * only the insert path takes a lock, and inserts are bounded by the number of
 * DISTINCT keys a title produces (a few hundred: its import set plus its syscall
 * set), not by how often it calls them. That is what keeps the hot path down to
 * a hash and an atomic add.
 *
 * Atomics are the __atomic builtins rather than C11 <stdatomic.h>, matching
 * runtime/platform/win32_compat.h: _Atomic and atomic_load_explicit are C-only
 * spellings and this tree is mixed C/C++. All four supported toolchains are
 * gcc or clang (clang-cl on Windows), so the builtins are always available.
